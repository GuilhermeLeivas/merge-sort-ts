# merge-sort-ts

Just a little project testing Merge Sort sorting algorithm in TypeScript.

For those who may try to execute it:

An easy approach is to use nodemon:
type on your terminal the following: <npm install -g nodemon>.
aftewards you're gonna be able to run the ts files from the project.
For that, just type <nodemon app.ts>
